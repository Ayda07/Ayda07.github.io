                        "Official policies of aggressive stops in minority neighborhoods generate future suspicion
                        shaped in part by the number of prior contacts. Even pure algorithmic suspicion, which should
                        avoid charges of racial bias, can be found to be infected with biases due to the way the models
                        are built or the data collected and trained," (Ferguson, 132-133).

                        "It is also a problem that arises because states are unlikely to gather and record all available
                        data; someone decides what to record and how to record it" (Levmore, 373).

                        "All told, New Orleans adopted 29 different programs focusing on family, school, job training,
                        reentry, and community and economic development.59 The goal of all of the changes was to target
                        those individuals most at risk of committing violence and then to provide alternatives, support,
                        and an opportunity to change." (Ferguson, 42).
